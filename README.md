# TranSpike

This is my first attempt to build a transformer for Spiking Neural Networks.
The idea is roughly following the paper *Fast-Classifying, High-Accuracy Spiking Deep Networks Through Weight and Threshold Balancing*.

This project is purely built by using Torch 7.

## Updates

+ Load pretrained VGG-16 network [TODO]
+ Print VGG-16 model, filters, and input, output stream [TODO]
+ Tackle matlab code for transfering ConvNet to SNNs [TODO]
